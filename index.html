    <p1>Macclesfield is surrounded by plenty of countryside to enjoy walks with family and friends.  There is a pathway called the Middlewood Way which uses an old railway line (rest assured, this is not used any more!).  We also have </p1>

    <li>Treacle Market</li>
    <p1>
    Macclesfield is known as Treacletown, referring to the centuries old accident when a horse drawn wagon overturned, spilling its cargo of Treacle onto the cobbles. The Treacle Market is a chance to find gorgeous things on Macclesfield's streets once again - Just less sticky.</p1>
    <p1>The Treacle Market takes place on the last Sunday of each month (excpet for December, which is the Sunday before Christmas... a chance for some extra presents!</p1>
    <p1>The market was started in 2010, and has grown in popularity through the years (taking a break during covid lockdown times).  There are over 160 stalls, including craft stalls, food and drink stalls, and more.  Some local shops also open for the day giving you a chance to take a break for much earned refreshments</p1>
